bikes <- merge(x=bikes, y=weather, by.x='updated.date', by.y='date')

# Univariate plots section

```{r}
temps <- melt(weather, id.vars='date', measure.vars=c('t.min','t','t.max'))
ggplot(temps, aes(x=variable, y=value)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(temps, aes(x=value, fill=variable)) + geom_density(alpha=0.3)
```

The three temperature measurements all have two peaks, which is surprising.

```{r}
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=d.updated, y=..count..+1)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=20) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

A few outliers. Let's zoom in on them.

```{r}
ggplot(bikes[bikes$d.updated >= 5000,], aes(x=d.updated)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5)
bikes[bikes$d.updated >= 5000, c('name', 'prev.updated', 'updated')]
```

```{r}
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=updated.time)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=600) +
  scale_x_datetime()
```

All times of day are reasonably well represented, as expected.

# Univariate Analysis

# Bivariate Plots Section

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y=precip.mm, x=rain)) + geom_boxplot()
```

If `rain` is false, `precip.mm` is almost always 0, but occasionally not. And if `rain` is true, `precip.mm` is still often 0. I wouldn't have expected that combination.

# Bivariate Analysis

Graph of the length of time spent with a given number of active docks:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=prev.num.docks, y=d.updated/60/24)) +
  geom_histogram(stat='identity') +
  facet_wrap(~name)
```

We see that every station was reporting less than a full complement of docks more than half the time; but only Southampton Place was completely out of service for any significant period.

What does the correlation look like between #bikes at each tick?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=num.bikes, y=prev.num.bikes, color=name)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.05)

cor.test(bikes$num.bikes, bikes$prev.num.bikes)
```

This is very strong correlation, with the most common outcome being that the number of bikes hasn't changed.

Are more journeys taken on non-rainy days?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(group_by(bikes, rain) %>% mutate(count=1/length(rain)),
       aes(x=d.num.bikes, y=count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  scale_x_discrete() +
  facet_wrap(~rain)
```

Looks like it. Slightly over 70% of observations have no bikes added or removed on rainy days, slightly under 70% on clear days. Confirming this numerically (taking the absolute value):

```{r}
summary(abs(bikes$d.num.bikes[bikes$rain]))
summary(abs(bikes$d.num.bikes[!bikes$rain]))
```

The mean is almost 25% higher on clear days than rainy days. What about fog?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(group_by(bikes, fog) %>% mutate(count=1/length(fog)),
       aes(x=d.num.bikes, y=count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  scale_x_discrete() +
  facet_wrap(~fog)

summary(abs(bikes$d.num.bikes[bikes$fog]))
summary(abs(bikes$d.num.bikes[!bikes$fog]))
```

Fog makes approximately no difference.

What about journeys on different weekdays?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=weekday, y=abs(d.num.bikes))) + geom_bar(stat='identity')
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=weekday, y=num.bikes)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Fewer journeys are taken on weekends. The median number of bikes available doesn't change much throughout the week, but the distribution does. Looking closer at that:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=num.bikes/num.docks)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~weekday)
```

Saturday and Sunday have noticeably different shapes to the others. They have a single peak, while weekdays are somewhat bimodal, with a small peak where the station is full (probably when people are arriving at work). Since the stations have different numbers of docks, I did a graph of fullness rather than of number of bikes.

(The density plot doesn't show peaks exactly at 0 and 1 because of how the window works, but histograms of num.bikes and num.spaces show that that's where they are. It would be difficult to use a histogram for this graph because there's no sensbile binwidth.)

I also want to look at the number of bikes available at specific times. Since I only have snapshots, I'm going to take the first observation after that time on any given day. Here's a function that lets me do that:

```{r}
# Take a time in format '0930', and return a boolean vector to select the
# appropriate entries from bikes.
at.time <- function(time) {
  # prev.updated.time < time <= updated.time is the obvious test. But it fails
  # around day boundaries, so we also check whether the date changed.
  # Additionally, ignore results where d.updated.time is too big, because those
  # may not be accurate.
  time <- strip.date(as.POSIXct(time, format='%H%M'))
  with(bikes, (prev.updated.time < time | prev.updated.date < updated.date) &
              time <= updated.time &
              d.updated <= 20)
}
```

So, number of slots available at 0930, when I'm trying to arrive at work:

```{r}
ggplot(bikes[at.time('0930'),], aes(x=num.spaces)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  facet_wrap(~name)
```

What's that in terms of frequency?

```{r}
ggplot(bikes[at.time('0930'),] %>% 
         group_by(name) %>% 
         mutate(count=1/length(name)),
       aes(x=num.spaces, y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity',binwidth=1) +
  facet_wrap(~name)
```

And now at 0940, in case I'm running late:

```{r}
ggplot(bikes[at.time('0940'),] %>% 
         group_by(name) %>% 
         mutate(count=1/length(name)),
       aes(x=num.spaces, y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity',binwidth=1) +
  facet_wrap(~name)
```

The 0s are all a little higher, but there's not much in it.
